# Brain-Tumor-Analysis

The aim is to classify brain tumor images using CNN and Xception models through transfer learning and custom convolutional layers, and use the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate explanations for the model's predictions.. Here is the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

Todo:
Fix opencv error to generate saliency maps
